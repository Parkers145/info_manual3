## Initialize on TF-Chain

For deployments, you'll need a TF-Chain account and a twin registered. You'll need both your mnemonic phrase and TwinID to pass to the Terraform plugin.

see [tfchain_portal_home](tfchain_portal_home) for how to use the portal.

> NOTE: We are working hard to have the runtime environments running in a fully stable manner. However, as we're still in test phase, it is recommended not to send too many tokens to TF-Chain for testing, until a further notice.
