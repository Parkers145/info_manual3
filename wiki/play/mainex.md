		terraform {
		  required_providers {
		    grid = {
			  source = "threefoldtech/grid"
			}
		}
	}
This block is specifying that the Terraform configuration will require the grid provider, which is made available by the threefoldtech/grid source.

		provider "grid" {
		}
This block is defining the configuration for the grid provider. In this case, the block is empty, which means that the provider is being configured with its default settings.

		resource "grid_network" "net1" {
			nodes = [3000]
			ip_range = "10.20.0.0/16"
			name = "mynetwork"
			description = "My internal Grid network"
			add_wg_access = true
		}
This block is defining a new resource of type grid_network, with the identifier net1. This resource represents a virtual network in the Threefold Grid. the grid_network resource has the identifier net1, These identifiers are used to refer to the resources elsewhere in the configuration.

For example, the network_name argument of the grid_deployment resource refers to the name attribute of the grid_network resource with the identifier net1

The block contains several arguments that are specific to the grid_network resource type:

- nodes: The nodes argument is a list of node IDs that should be included in the network. When a node is added to a network, it is assigned an IP address from the network's IP range, and it becomes available to host applications or workloads.
- ip_range: the ip_range argument specifies the IP range of the network. An IP range is a range of IP addresses that are available for use on a network. It is specified using the CIDR notation, which consists of an IP address followed by a slash and the number of bits of the address that are used for the network prefix.
- name: The name of a network is a human-readable identifier that is used to refer to the network within the Threefold Grid. It is not required to be unique, but it is typically used to distinguish between different networks in the Grid.
- description: A description of the network.
- add_wg_access: The add_wg_access argument in the grid_network resource controls whether WireGuard access should be enabled for the network. When add_wg_access is set to true, the grid provider will create a WireGuard access point for the network. This allows users to connect to the network using the WireGuard VPN protocol.

		resource "grid_deployment" "d1" {
		node = 3000
		network_name = grid_network.net1.name
		ip_range = lookup(grid_network.net1.nodes_ip_range, 3000, "")
		disks {
			name = "root"
			size = 50
		}
	
This part of the block is defining a new resource of type grid_deployment, with the identifier d1. This resource represents a deployment of virtual machines in the Threefold Grid.the grid_deployment resource has the identifier d1. This identifier is used to refer to the resource elsewhere in the configuration.

For example, the node1_vm1_ip output variable refers to the ip attribute of the first virtual machine in the vms list of the grid_deployment resource with the identifier d1, using the following syntax:

The block contains several arguments that are specific to the grid_deployment resource type:

- node: The node argument specifies the node ID of the node where the deployment should be created. 
- network_name: The network_name argument specifies the name of the network to which the deployment should be connected. The deployment will be assigned an IP address from the network's IP range, and it will be able to communicate with other nodes and devices on the network.
- ip_range: The ip_range argument specifies the IP range of the deployment. The deployment will be assigned an IP address from this range, and it will be used to assign IP addresses to the virtual machines and disks in the deployment.
- disks: the disks block specifies one or more disks that should be created and attached to the deployment. A disk in the Threefold Grid is a block storage device that can be used to store data. Disks can be attached to a deployment and mounted on virtual machines or other nodes in the deployment.


			vms {
			name = "tftest"
			description ="Terraform deployment test"
			flist = "https://hub.grid.tf/tf-official-vms/ubuntu-22.04-lts.flist"
			cpu = 4
			publicip = true

				mount_point = "/data"
			}
			planetary = true
			env_vars = {
			SSH_KEY ="ADD YOUR SSH KEY HERE"
			}
		}
	}
	
The vms block specifies one or more virtual machines that should be created and attached to the deployment.

A virtual machine (VM) in the Threefold Grid is a logical representation of a computer that is hosted on a node in the Grid. VMs can be used to host applications or workloads, and they can be configured with different CPU, memory, and storage resources to meet the needs of the workload.

The vms block can include one or more vm blocks, each of which specifies the properties of a single VM. In the provided main.tf file, the vms block includes a single vm block with the following arguments:	
- name: The name of the VM, which is "tftest" in this case.
- description: A description of the VM, which is "Terraform deployment test" in this case.
- flist: The URL of a file list that specifies the root filesystem of the VM. The file list specifies the files and directories that should be included in the VM's root filesystem.
- cpu: The number of CPU cores that should be allocated to the VM. In this case, the VM is allocated 4 CPU cores.
- publicip: A flag that indicates whether the VM should be assigned a public IPv4 address. If set to true, the `
- publicip6: A flag that indicates whether the VM should be assigned a public IPv6 address. If set to true, the grid provider will assign a public IPv6 address to the VM.
- memory: The amount of memory (in MB) that should be allocated to the VM. In this case, the VM is allocated 8192MB of memory.
- mounts: A list of disk mounts that should be created for the VM. Each mount block specifies the properties of a single disk mount. In this case, the mounts block includes a single mount block that mounts the disk with the name "root" at the /data mount point on the VM.
- planetary: A flag that indicates whether the VM should be configured to run on the Planetary network. The Planetary network is a decentralized network that allows users to host applications and workloads on a global network of nodes. If set to true, the VM will be configured to run on the Planetary network.
- env_vars: A map of environment variables that should be set on the VM. Each key-value pair in the map represents an environment variable and its value. In this case, the env_vars map includes a single environment variable called SSH_KEY, which is set to the value "ADD YOUR SSH KEY HERE".

		output "wg_config" {
			value = grid_network.net1.access_wg_config
		}
This block is defining an output variable called wg_config. The value of the output will be the access_wg_config attribute of the grid_network resource with the identifier net1. This output can be used to display the WireGuard configuration for the network.

		output "node1_vm1_ip" {
			value = grid_deployment.d1.vms[0].ip
		}
This block is defining an output variable called node1_vm1_ip. The value of the output will be the ip attribute of the first virtual machine in the vms list of the grid_deployment resource with the identifier d1.

		output "public_ip" {
			value = grid_deployment.d1.vms[0].computedip
		}
This block is defining an output variable called public_ip. The value of the output will be the computedip attribute of the first virtual machine in the vms list of the grid_deployment resource with the identifier d1. This output can be used to display the public IP address of the virtual machine.

		output "public_ip6" {
			value = grid_deployment.d1.vms[0].computedip6
This block is defining an output variable called public_ip6. The value of the output will be the computedip6 attribute of the first virtual machine in the vms list of the grid_deployment resource with the identifier d1.

The computedip6 attribute represents the public IPv6 address of the virtual machine, as computed by the grid provider. This output can be used to display the public IPv6 address of the virtual machine.

		output "ygg_ip" {
			value = grid_deployment.d1.vms[0].ygg_ip
		}
This block is defining an output variable called ygg_ip. The value of the output will be the ygg_ip attribute of the first virtual machine in the vms list of the grid_deployment resource with the identifier d1.

The ygg_ip attribute represents the Planetary Network IP address of the virtual machine. The Planetary Network is an experimental networking protocol that provides an encrypted IPv6 network. This output can be used to display the Planetary network IP address of the virtual machine.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
