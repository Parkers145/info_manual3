# <center> Deploying on The Threefold Playground </center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a Fully Setup Profile you now have access to deploy any of the VPS solutions available on the playground on one of thousands of nodes located across the world. The flagship deployment solution is the industry standard [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) VPS Full VM. This solution provides you the ultimate flexibility to deploy your solutions on the grid’s hardware. with the recent addition of Full-VMs you can now truly say that if you can do it in Linux, you can do it on the grid. you can deploy your VPS when you need it, where you need it, and you can delete it at any time with no lasting commitment providing the ultimate environment for deployment testing and prototyping of cloud solutions. 

- Customized Full VM Linux images can be created for the grid using the process here [Manipulating Cloud Images for the Grid](https://forum.threefold.io/t/manipulating-cloud-images-for-the-grid/3380)
	
- Docker Hub images can be converted on the [Threefold Hub](https://Hub.Grid.tf)

The Playground is also host to several use case specific deployments that further automate the deployment process of end-user solutions on the Threefold Grid. Many of these solutions are designed to allow everyday users to contribute to other projects that share the vision of a decentralized world. The Threefold grid is designed to support decentralization, not compete with other forms, and is intended to provide a solid hosting support infrastructure to both crypto-currencies and otherwise decentralization focused projects. Currently the grids deployment solutions include.
