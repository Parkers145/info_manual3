# <center> Playground Interface Setup </Center>
In order to access the play interface you will use the [PolkdaDot-js Extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/), Once you have this extension you will have a couple options on how to create your wallet, 
- If your strictly looking to deploy and have an existing stellar wallet, creating one in the browser extension is a great option.
- Threefold also offers an integrated solution to your grid identities and wallets with the Threefold Connect App available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&hl=en_US&gl=US) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885)
	- Creating your wallet in the Threefold Connect App, then importing that wallet into a 3rd party interface allows you to manage all stellar based crypto currencies from one wallet address, the recovery phrase from threefold connect can also be imported into the [Polkdaot-js](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) basing all of your grid functions from a single wallet. 
	
Once you have Created your wallet and imported it into the [Polkdaot-js](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) extension, you will visit the [Threefold Dashboard](https://Dashboard.grid.tf) Here you will Agree to the Grids Terms and Conditions and Create your Digital Twin, this is your identity on the grid and represents you as deployer or a farmer. This also will be the account that the TFT you intend to use for deployments will be held in. Once you have Accepted the Terms and Agreements you proceed to create your profile on the [Playground](https://play.grid.tf)
- If you did not use the Threefold Connect App to create your wallet you will need to use Swap function on the dashboard to retrieve the stellar deposit address of your Digital twin. you can do this now while your on the dashboard, or you can do it after creating your deployment profile. **be sure you use the address and memo for twin deposits**

Once you arrive on the [Playground](https://play.grid.tf) you will click the gear in the top right icon and create your deployment profile, this is how the interface knows what Twin is creating and managing the deployments being created and you will need a couple pieces of information.  
- Profile Name: this will be the name of your deployment profile, you can have multiple profiles representing different wallets, solutions, or access levels,
- Mnemonics: These are the words from the wallet you created in the extension or the threefold connect app. 
- Public SSH Key: This where you put the text of your .pub ssh key file that coincides with the private key you wish to access your deployments with. This key will be added to the known hosts of each deployment and typically represents how you will initially gain access to your deployment. 

After Creating your profile, it will load the twin id you created in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf) and generate a QR code that allows you to transfer your funds from the Threefold Connect App wallet onto your deployment profile. If you are using a third-party wallet the QR code may not be functional in your wallet, you can go to "swap" on the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf) and retrieve the Wallet address and memo for depositing to your twin from any stellar wallet address. **be sure you use the address and memo for twin deposits**
