# <center>The Threefold Playground</center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Threefold Playground is a Decentralized, user facing interface that allows users who have little to no coding ability to access the resources that have been developed for the grid. This interface uses a Browser-Based Polkadot Extension to extend the users Blockchain identity to their browser allowing management of Industry-standard VPS deployments as well as use case specific tools that have been developed by the Decentralized Community interacting only with the Blockchain itself. Deploying on the Playground is Simple.
