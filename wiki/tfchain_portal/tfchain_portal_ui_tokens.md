# Manage your TFT on TFChain

## Transfer TFT between Stellar Network and TF-Chain

A minimum amount of TFT is sponsored for the initial setup, but as every action on TF-Chain requires some small TFT amount, TFT can be sent over from the Stellar network. 
Also, capacity that is reserved is paid to the Substrate account. For multiple reasons (selling, storing, ...) you might need to transfer this amount to the Stellar network. There is a bridge between the two blockchains available, and transfers can be launched as indicated below. 

### Deposit

A deposit of tokens from the Stellar network onto TF-Chain needs to happen from a Stellar wallet, like in the ThreeFold Connect App. 

- TFT needs to be sent to the bridge account 
- specifying in the memo field the twinID that was generated with the Twin creation e.g. twin_110 (dont forget twin_)
- Note there is a transaction cost of 1 TFT.
