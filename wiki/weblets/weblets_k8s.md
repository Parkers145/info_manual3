# Kubernetes 

Kubernetes is the standard for container orchestration.

On the TF grid, someone can deploy a Kubernetes orchestrator out of the box. We have implemented [K3S](https://k3s.io/), a full-blown Kubernetes offering that uses only half of the memory footprint. It is packaged as a single binary and made more lightweight to run workloads in resource-constrained locations (fits e.g. IoT, edge, ARM workloads).

We have integrated TFGrid support inside Kubernetes, from within CapRover you can now add/remove 3Nodes to extend the size of your cluster.

## How does it work ?

We have developed a set of weblets which allow you to deploy workloads in a very easy way.
