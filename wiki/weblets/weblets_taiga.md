- Enter an Application Name. It's used in generating a unique subdomain on one of the gateways on the network alongside your twin ID. Ex. ***tg98taigar*.gent02.dev.grid.tf**

- Enter administrator information including **Username**, **Email** and **Password**. This admin user will have full permission on the deployed instance.

- Choose a node to deploy your Funkwhale instance on.

- Either use the **Capacity Filter**. Which simply lets you pick a *Farm* and *Country*, after clicking on *Apply filters and suggest nodes* then it lists available nodes with these preferences and you pick.
