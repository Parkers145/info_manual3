# Weblets

Weblets are a super cool way how to deploy solutions on our tfgrid.

A weblet is a compiled javascript component which can be embedded in any website.
The weblet uses the TFChain javascript client to talk directly to TFChain and ZOS enabled nodes over RMB.

__Advantages__ :

- It makes it very easy to deploy a solution
- It is 100% decentralized, there is no server involved

## Some cool weblets to start with

- [Caprover](weblets_caprover)
- [Virtual Machine](weblets_vm)
- [Kubernetes](weblets_k8s)
- [Funkwhale](weblets_funkwhale)
- [Peertube](weblets_peertube)
- [Taiga](weblets_taiga)
- [Owncloud](weblets_owncloud)
- [Discourse](weblets_discourse)

## Playground

Playgrounds are available on [https://play.grid.tf](https://play.grid.tf) for Mainnet, [https://play.dev.grid.tf](https://play.dev.grid.tf) for Devnet and [https://play.test.grid.tf](https://play.test.grid.tf) for Testnet.

### limitations
- can only deploy one thing at a time
- it may take sometime to deploy a solution like peertube, so you should wait a little bit until it's fully runningg
