# Weblets

Weblets are a super cool way how to deploy solutions on our tfgrid.

A weblet is a compiled javascript component which can be embedded in any website.
The weblet uses the TFChain javascript client to talk directly to TFChain and ZOS enabled nodes over RMB.

Advantages

- make it easier to deploy a solution
- 100% decentralized, there is no server involved
